In each subfolder gband/ and rband/, you will find the light curve
(ascii) files for all TDSS RQS quasars, one file per object and per
band, g or r.
In the file ID_list.dat, you will find the light curve file names in
the first column, followed by the RA, Dec in the next two
columns. The median i-band magnitude and the chi^2 in the g and r
bands are listed in the last three columns; these three parameters
determined whether they were targeted as high priority or not. It
would be nice to show these values on the light curve panel, and to
plot the gband and r band as different symbols/colors.


FOR NON-VARIABILITY SELECTED TARGETS:
We use magnitude limit instead. These targets are listed in NGCmagselect_noLC.txt.


FOR VARIABILITY-SELECTED TARGETS:

Both SDSS and Pan-STARRS photometry are listed in the light curves.
Light curve filenames are based on either:
      A) the SDSS_NAME (e.g., 000000.97+044947.2) from the DR7 or DR12
      quasar catalogs, or
      B) an internal ID (e.g., 42499) for newly discovered quasars in
      the v5_9_1 SpAll file which did not have SDSS_NAME defined at
      the time of target selection.

UPDATE May 21 2019:
Not enough space on GitHub to write all the above light curves, so will only
write out those that ended up getting observed by TDSS (see RQS-01Jul2018.txt)
Now:
No. lightcurves in gband/ folder 14109
No. lightcurves in rband/ folder 14109
