In each subfolder gband/ and rband/, you will find the light curve
(ascii) files for all TDSS RQS quasars, one file per object and per
band, g or r.
In the file ID_list.dat, you will find the light curve file names in
the first column, followed by the RA, Dec in the next two
columns. The median i-band magnitude and the chi^2 in the g and r
bands are listed in the last three columns; these three parameters
determined whether they were targeted as high priority or not. It
would be nice to show these values on the light curve panel, and to
plot the gband and r band as different symbols/colors.

Both SDSS and Pan-STARRS photometry are listed in the light curves.
